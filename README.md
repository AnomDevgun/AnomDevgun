# Hello there stranger or acquaintance! ðŸ‘‹
## I am currently a computer science postgrad student and am utterly fascinated by complexities of not only the software, but also the designs that are the basis of even the tiniest of  things in technology. I enjoy problem solving alongside a healthy dose of creativity and thought provocation.
### My current areas of learning and application are:
### >Flutter app development.
### >Web Development
### >Python, C and C++ programming.
### >Machine Learning.
