# Hello there stranger or acquaintance! 👋
## I am a computer science undergrad currently and am utterly fascinated by complexities of not only the software, but even the designs that are the basis of even the tiniest of  things in technology. I enjoy problem solving alongside a healthy dose of creativity and thought provocation.
### My current areas of learning and application are:
### >Flutter app development.
### >Python, C and C++ programming.
### >Machine Learning.
#### I firmly believe in the freedom of code and in opensource development as a result of which all of my work is available in various repositories for anyones access.
## *Technology is our past, present and future, capable of the most amazing things limited only by our imagination.*
